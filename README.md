### 2025 - Mass-specific dataset construction and data analysis
## Overview
This repository gathers the codes and data we used in the study. First is the dataset construction, and second is the data analysis. Codes and data generated and transformed in the study are separated in their respective folders.

## Brief summary of the study


## Layout
The repository is split into two main directories: The first one is about the dataset construction, and the second about data analysis. 
Each folder contains an Input folder (in the data analysis folder: the dataset construction is the input data), a Script folder, and an Output folder.

The dataset construction folder has two stepps. First is the collection of the mass-specific data. Second is the input of the mass-specific data and other traits values into the inference process. The inference process is used as input of the data analysis.
